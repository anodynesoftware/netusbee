General notes on this repository
--------------------------------

Why two binaries?
-----------------
Because the chip used by the NetUSBee (Philips ISP1160) requires certain
delays between accesses, and those delays are not ensured by the supporting
hardware, the delays are provided by executing "do-nothing" instructions.
However, a general purpose delay routine has overheads that significantly
reduce maximum transfer rates on slow CPU chips, such as the 68000.
Therefore, we create two versions of the driver:
	netusbst.prg	suitable for 68000 CPUs at 8MHz and 16MHz only
	netusbee.prg	suitable for all 680x0 CPUs, but will run slower on
					68000s than netusbst.prg

Notes on compiling
------------------
The Makefile is set up to link the program with Markus Froschle's excellent
libcmini library (using startup.o & libcmini.a), resulting in very compact
executables (< 14KB).  The latest version of the library is available from
GitHub at this URL:
	https://github.com/mfro0/libcmini/releases
For my simplistic purposes, I just copied startup.o & libcmini.a to the
root of the repository, and then the Makefile works as-is.

You can of course change the Makefile to use the standard GCC C library, but
the resulting binaries will be several times larger.
